# CS300Projects
Projects for my CS-300 Data Structures Class



What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was tasked with creating programs for sorting course data and loading them from a file.

How did you approach the problem?
I ended up looking at a bunch of different data strucutres and decided which one was optimal for the program.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I didn't really encounter any roadblocks during the process, early on I had a problem that involved being unable to read a file due to its location not being correct but beyond that I ran into no problems.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It allowed me the opportunity to be given an issue and impliment a program for solving it while maintaining a clean code.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Given the project's ability to use multiple data sets (Lists of courses) it can be reused in the future if necessary.
